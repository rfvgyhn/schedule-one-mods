Need to copy/symlink the following DLLs from the game's proxied DLLs to the `lib` directory. These can
be found in `steamapps/common/Schedule I/MelonLoader/Il2CppAssemblies` after running MelonLoader at least
once.
* Assembly-CSharp
* Il2Cppmscorlib
* UnityEngine.CoreModule
* UnityEngine.TextRenderingModule
* UnityEngine.UI
